# Layers

This module contains a lot of the model-functionality of KMonad. However, this
code is also on the chopping block. At the moment we're working on getting the
Shell part of KMonad working well, and a lot of the code in Layers is old code
that is running inside a new Shell. Once Shell is solid, this will all be
redone. 

Don't trust anything you see here.
